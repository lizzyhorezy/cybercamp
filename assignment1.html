            poster with an oscar wilde quote proclaiming that <q>work is the
                refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. although many
            considered her pioneering work. unraveling the secret of the llama <abbr
                title="deoxyribonucleic acid">dna</abbr>.to be an outstanding achievement.
